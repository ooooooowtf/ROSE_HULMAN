	In this article, Campbell, Hoane Jr., and Hsu describe the progression of the Deep Blue project, a machine capable of competing against and beating the worlds top chess players. This process has been developing over a many decades (since mid-1990s) to the product we have today. It began with the Deep Blue I which evolved into the Deep Blue II, an improved version of the original. While the first version was successful, the second version implemented a wide range of improvements to improve the speed and win rate of the machine (such as medium-scale processing, enhanced evaluation hardware, improved search software, and an extended book). The main reason both machines were so successful is their unthinkable ability to search. The machines were designed both within the hardware and within the algorithms to have immense searching power for the most effective moves to make reaching speeds of hundreds of millions positions per second. For this reason, grandmasters from around the world struggled to beat the machine and even lost on numerous occasions. To create such a machine, a lot of analysis went into the thought process of the machine. This analysis starts from the very beginning of the game at the opener all the way to the finishing moves to checkmate the opponent. The creators of this machine worked with grandmasters to help create the best machine possible which is one of the main reasons it was able to compete with the worlds top chess players.
