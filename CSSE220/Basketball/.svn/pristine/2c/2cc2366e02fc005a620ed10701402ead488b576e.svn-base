Reflection Questions:

1. How are your two (Warm-Up vs. Stage 1) designs different? Which do you think is superior and why? If you think they are equally good/bad explain why.
two design is different on the way class handle function and data. I think the
second one is better because information is transfered in a cleaner and more readable
way




2. After implementing your design, did you have to change the original UML? If so, what did you have to change and why did you have to change it? If not, explain how you made your decisions in designing.

I change a whole class. I used to implement a new class to calculate statistics,
but now information is evenly distributed in every class



3. If you were to use your original code (from the Warm Up) and try to use it to match the explicit requirements of Stage 1, do you think it would be easier or harder to code than the re-designed UML? Why? (You are permitted to try to actually implement it if you want to in order to help answer this question)
it is easier to implement but also is a bad function.




4. Select two or more specific design principles and discuss how they relate to the your experience in designing and implementing the code for Stage 1.
i follow the princple of 1a 1b.
