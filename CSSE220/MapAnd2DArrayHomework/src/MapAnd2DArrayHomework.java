	 * BONUS: Extra credit problem

	 * Feel free to skip this one if you don't have time. It's a little harder.

	 * south east or west.

	 * The ball always starts at position 1,1
	 *
	 * It will always choose the path of steepest descent. It will eventually
	 * come to rest when it is at a position where all neighboring positions are
	 * higher/equal. Return the elevation of that position.
	 * 
	 * You can assume that map will be such that the ball will always come to
	 * rest without moving through an edge
	 * 
	 * You can assume there will always be one steepest position for the ball to
	 * go to
	 * 
	 * For example, in an array like this: 9999 9549 9999 yields 4 The ball
	 * would start in 1,1 (5) rolls to 4 and stops
	 * 
	 * 99999999999 98711111199 96999999999 95444444399 99999999999 yields 4 The
