    Constructs and returns a   ttk.Frame   on the given root window.
    The frame contains all of this module's widgets.
    Does NOT   grid   the Frame, since the caller will do that.
    Also sets up callbacks for this module's widgets.

    The first argument is the  root  window (a tkinter.Tk object)
