# INSTRUCTIONS:  For every in-class session, including Session 2:
#
#  1. Do the Preparation first.
#       -- Ask your instructor for advice if you arrive to the
#          in-class session without having done the Preparation.
#
#  2. Check out the project for the session using:
#         SVN ~ Checkout
#
#  3. Work through the files (aka modules) in order: m0, m1, ...
#
#       -- EXAMPLE modules are named with an 'e', like this:
#              m0e_instructions.py   m4e_...  m6e_...

#          For example modules:
#            -- RUN them (so you see what they do).
#            -- Read or skim them, as you see fit.
#            -- Come BACK to them as needed for examples.
#
#       -- For NON-example files, look for the phrase
#              TODO
#          and do the exercise per the TODO's instructions.
#
#          Horizontal blue bars on the scroll-like thing to the right
#          of the editor window bring you straight to the TODO's.
#
#  4. Use    SVN ~ Commit
#     to commit your work (i.e., to turn it in).
#      -- Do FREQUENT commits, as often as you want.
#      -- You can RE-commit a changed module, no problem.
#      -- A black dot beside the module name means that you have made
#           changes that you have not yet committed.
#           (We say that the file is "dirty".)
#      -- Mark each   TODO   as   DONE   when you complete that TODO.
#           That way, you will know that you have completed the exercise
#           when all the horizontal blue bars on the scroll-like thing
#           to the right of the editor window are gone.
#
# Do not get "stuck" on any exercise - no single TODO today should
# take you more than about 5 minutes.  Instead:
#
#     ** ASK QUESTIONS **  as needed.
#
# After you have read these instructions, do them.
# There is nothing to turn in from this file.
