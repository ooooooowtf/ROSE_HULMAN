#
# DONE: 2.
#   (Yes, that means for YOU to DO things per these instructions:)
#
#   READ the code above.  Be sure you understand:
#     -- How many functions are defined above?
#           (Answer: 4)
#     -- For each function definition:
#          -- Where does that function definition begin?
#             Where does it end?
#     -- How many times does   main   call the   turtle1   function?
#            (Answer: 1)
#     -- How many times does   main   call the   turtle2   function?
#            (Hint: the answer is NOT 1.)
#     -- What line of code calls the   main   function?
#            (Answer: look at the LAST line of this module, far below.)
#
#     ** ASK QUESTIONS if you are uncertain. **
#
#   When you believe you understand the answers
#   to all of the above questions, change the above TODO to DONE.
#
########################################################################


########################################################################
# DONE: 3.
#   RUN this module.
#
#   RELATE what is DRAWN to the CODE above.  Be sure you understand:
#       -- WHEN does the code in   main   run?
#       -- WHEN does the code in   turtle1   run?
#                    the code in   turtle2   run?
#                    the code in   turtle3   run?
#       -- For each of the above, WHY does that code run when it does?
#
#     ** ASK QUESTIONS if you are uncertain. **
#
#   When you believe you understand the answers
#   to all of the above questions, change the above TODO to DONE.
#
########################################################################

########################################################################
#
# DONE: 4.
#   Define another function,
#   immediately below the end of the definition of   turtle3   above.
#   Name your new function   turtle4.
#
#   The Python "pep8" coding standard says to leave exactly 2 blank
#   lines between function definitions, so be sure to do so.
#
#   Your new function should:
#
#    1. Define a SimpleTurtle (as   turtle3   and other functions did).
#
#    2. Set your SimpleTurtle's
#               pen
#       to a new rg.Pen with a color and thickness of your own choosing.
#       See the  COLORS.pdf  and  COLORS.txt  files in this project
#       for lists all legal color-names.
#
#    3. Make your SimpleTurtle move around a bit.

#           ** IMPORTANT:                 **
#           ** Nothing fancy is required. **
#           ** KISS.                      **
#           ** Save fancy stuff for exercises later today. **
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   BTW, if you see a RED mark to the left of the line number
#     of one of your lines, that means that there is
#     a SYNTAX (notation) error at that line or elsewhere.
#   Get help as needed to fix any such errors.
#
########################################################################

########################################################################
#
# DONE: 5.
#   Add a line to   main   that CALLS your new function immediately
#   AFTER  main  calls turtle1.  So:
#     -- the SimpleTurtle from turtle1 should move,
#     -- then YOUR SimpleTurtle should move,
#     -- then the other 3 SimpleTurtles should move.
#
#   Run this module.  Check that there is another SimpleTurtle (yours)
#   that uses the pen you chose and moves around a bit.
#   If your code has errors (shows RED in the Console window)
#   or does not do what it should, get help as needed to fix it.
#
########################################################################

########################################################################
#
# DONE: 6.
#   The previous two TODOs IMPLEMENTED a function (TODO 4)
#   and TESTED that function (TODO 5).
#
#   Now implement AND test one more function, defining it immediately
#   below the definition of your   turtle4   function.
#   Name your new function   turtle5.
#
#   The Python "pep8" coding standard says to leave exactly 2 blank
#   lines between function definitions, so be sure to do so.
#
#   Your new function should define TWO new SimpleTurtles,
#   set their characteristics (i.e., instance variables) as you choose,
#   and make each move a bit.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#           ** IMPORTANT:                 **
#           ** Nothing fancy is required. **
#           ** KISS.                      **
#           ** Save fancy stuff for exercises later today. **
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  Get help as needed on this (and every!) exercise!
#
#  As always COMMIT your work (which turns it in) as often as you want,
#  but for sure after you have tested it and believe that it is correct,
#  by selecting this module
#       and doing     SVN ~ Commit.
